### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Emine Yilmaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ocmAN4YAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Jun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIE1tY4AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests lie in conversational AI, neural semantic parsing, information retrieval, social network analysis, and machine learning. Currently, I am focused on task-oriented dialogue systems and conversational question answering. I also have a strong passion for graph convolutional networks.

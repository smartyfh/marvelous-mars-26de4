### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I finished my PhD in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Emine Yilmaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ocmAN4YAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Jun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIE1tY4AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests lie in conversational AI, information retrieval, social network analysis, and large language models.

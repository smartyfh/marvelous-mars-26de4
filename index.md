### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at Univeristy College London (UCL). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Emine Yilmaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ocmAN4YAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests lie in conversational AI, neural semantic parsing, information retrieval, social network analysis, and machine learning. Currently, I am focused on task-oriented dialogue systems and conversational question answering. I also have a strong passion in graph convolutional networks.
